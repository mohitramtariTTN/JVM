/***
 * Question 5) Write a program to simulate a deadlock in java
 * and then improve the program to handle the deadlock using reentract lock.
 *
 * Explanation : Here I am creating a situation, which will result into a deadlock and will stop the
 * execution of the program
 * Here, I have made two operations operation1 and operation2 and two threads Thread1 and Thread2.
 * Thread1 is using operation1 and Thread2 is using Operation2.
 * Thread1 will have a lock on lock1 and Thread2 will have a lock on lock2, so now Thread1 needs a lock
 * on lock2 and Thread2 needs a lock on lock1, so both will be waiting for each other, resulting in deadlock.
