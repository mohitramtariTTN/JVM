/***
 * Question 5) Write a program to simulate a deadlock in java
 * and then improve the program to handle the deadlock using reentract lock.
 * Explanation : Here i am solving the deadlock, by using a while loop. In operation1, first i am
 * acquiring a lock on lock1 and then it goes for lock2, if it is successful then it breaks the while loop,
 * if it is not then it will stuck in the loop until both locks are acquired by Thread1.
 * Same goes for Thread2 and operation2. By this, it will not stuck in the loop
